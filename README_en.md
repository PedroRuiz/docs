# docs
(_Para leer en español [pulsa aquí](README_en.md)_)

### What is docs?
Docs is a module part of the container application [Modular](https://github.com/PedroRuiz/modular). This module is a simple text editor.

### What makes it special?
Being a module, everything is already preconfigured and its installation within **Modular** is quite simple.

## How to install?
- It necessarily has to be previously installed **Modular**.
- From a terminal, go to the ROOTPATH.'/Modular' directory of your module installation.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PedroRuiz/docs
```
- Make sure the directory name is "Docs".

- Go to the root of your Modular installation. From a terminal:
```bash
$ php spark migrate -n Docs
```

That's all. Enjoy.
